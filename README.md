Based on challenge from Coursera to create a miles to kilometers conversion app using JS.
This is based on a challenge/project from the Coursera course "JavaScript For Beginners" (Instructor: William Mead)
The original project was to build a distance conversion tool (miles to kilometers and kilometers to miles).
The goal is this particular project was to use vanilla JS and HTML only (and CSS for styling) to conveert Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit.
React was not a part of this project.
This may be updated in the future to help refine it, update it, and elevate it.
